# SpaceBounce-LongBounce-Bot
I decided to share our v3 SpaceBounceBrakes and v3 LongBounce bot after a long time, you can change it as you wish. There is no problem. I showed you how to operate it with pictures.
Our bot works with the localstoragemanager plugin and we keep our stats in that plugin.

I explained the installation with pictures, and if you have a question, you can contact us via discord. Discord my name is aykakule

If there is anyone who understands the bot edit, he can adjust everything in it according to himself.

Rank system available (No Discord integration)
Automatically changes the color of the jersey after a goal (You set the colors)
etc.
